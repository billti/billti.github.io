My name is Bill Ticehurst and I'm a software developer living in Seattle.

My main areas of interest are [JavaScript](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/) &
[TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org), C++, [V8](https://v8.dev),
and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Thoughts on this site are my own and don't represent the views of my employer.

This site is based on the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.
