================

Personal site, based on the Jekyll template at https://github.com/jekyll/minima

Set up for local development as per
https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/

Build & serve locally with: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
To see the Minima folder: `bundle show minima`

Note that other sites running on localhost may have set the HSTS policy requiring SSL, which will
block loading the site over clear text. Delete any such policies via `chrome://net-internals/#hsts`

If drafting content <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#drafts> run bundle with the `--drafts` switch.

A H1 header is provided based on the page title. Create a paragraph under this which
becomes the abstract. Other headers should be at most H2.

## TODO
